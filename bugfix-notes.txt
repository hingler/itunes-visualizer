fixes to the vorbismanager

	- StopWriteThread is only called on dtor if the thread is active
	- Buffers are populated on first write call (avoids empty case)
	- note: remove sleep call on thread wind down
	
	- write calls did not take channel size into account (new var: writesize)
	- uninit'd run_thread_ value
	- improper data passed to callback (should have been CallbackPacket, but only the signal was passed)
