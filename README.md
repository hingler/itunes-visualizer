## History

Like any other, our product's story is one of humble beginnings. We got our start in 1898, back in the days well before laundry machines, when you couldn't just head to the local supermarket for liquid detergent. Our founder, a missus Francis Aithon, believed in the simpler things, and nobody knew better than her that if you wanted something done, you had to do it yourself. She used ingredients straight off the farm, and after some convincing, she took her soap to the local farmer's market, selling out every batch she brought in. It wasn't long before the Aithon family was a household name among locals.

Over a hundred years, and five generations later, we're still doing things the Aithon way, with all-natural ingredients that you can find at any grocery store. That's why the Better Business Bureau has named us among America's Greenest Companies for nearly two decades. And in true Aithon fashion, if you're not satisfied with our product, give us a call and we'll refund your purchase, no questions asked.
