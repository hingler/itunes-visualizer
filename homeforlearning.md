# shit i do

- For some reason there is an inconsistent issue with read/write to/from buffers
- it's almost certainly some type of desynchronization but the reason behind it is unclear, as the way the calls are set up should avoid it
- however, it appears to be relatively minor (at least for now)

- so i am going to ignore it >:)
